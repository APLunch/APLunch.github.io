## Objective
The primary goal of the "Kitchen Chaos" project is to develop a streamlined version of the acclaimed video game "Overcooked" utilizing the Unity 3D engine. This endeavor is designed to refine and enhance my technical proficiency in Unity 3D development, with a particular focus on understanding and applying Unity's advanced features and updates. Through this project, I aim to deepen my expertise in game development within Unity 3D, leveraging public domain game assets to create an engaging and functional game prototype.

## Technical Summary
The "Kitchen Chaos" project incorporates essential Unity 3D tools and C# features to achieve its development goals, including Animation, Cinemachine, World Canvas, the Unity Input System, collision detection, and shaders. It also utilizes advanced programming concepts such as C# Events, the Singleton pattern, Scriptable Objects, and C# interfaces to enhance game functionality and design efficiency. The game asset is publicly available.

## Results
The "Kitchen Chaos" project resulted in a simplified yet engaging version of a game inspired by "Overcooked", utilizing Unity 3D. Key Unity tools and C# features were effectively employed to ensure responsive gameplay and visual appeal. This prototype demonstrates the practical application of Unity development skills and programming concepts, showcasing a solid foundation in game design and development within the Unity environment.
