## Objective
The goal of this project was to build a fully immersive teleoperation system for a 6-DOF manipulator, allowing a human operator to intuitively control the robot in VR while automatically recording high-quality demonstration data.  
This enables natural, low-latency control for complex manipulation tasks and serves as a foundation for training reinforcement learning or imitation learning policies using realistic teleoperated data.

## Technical Summary
The system integrates ROS 2, Unity, and a Meta Quest 3 VR headset through a custom ROS–TCP bridge.  
A panoramic (equirectangular) camera mounted near **Joint 1** provides a 360° video stream synchronized with the robot’s **320×200 point cloud** and joint states. An RGBD camera is also mounted on the robot to provide spatial data of the workspace. 
Operators can observe the workspace from the robot’s perspective and issue motion targets or control end-effector poses directly through VR interactions.  
All sessions automatically log synchronized **joint trajectories**, **RGB-D point clouds**, and **360° panoramic streams**, forming demonstration datasets compatible with frameworks like **LeRobot** or **Unity ML-Agents** for downstream policy learning.

## Results
Achieved stable, low-latency control across multiple test sessions, enabling remote execution of pick-and-place and manipulation demonstrations.  
The VR interface provided a natural and intuitive teleoperation experience, significantly reducing the time to collect diverse, high-fidelity training data.  
This setup now serves as the foundation for ongoing **reinforcement learning-based policy training**, bridging human teleoperation and autonomous manipulation under real-world sensing conditions.
