## Objective
Pixmo, Anyware Robotics’ autonomous unloading robot, uses a conveyor-based accessory system to handle a wide variety of packages. However, limited perception over the conveyor region previously forced conservative motion planning, reducing speed and risking collision with boxes and hardware.  
The objective of this project was to develop a robust, real-time multi-camera perception system that continuously monitors the conveyor workspace, enabling faster picking, automated failure detection, and safe collision-free operation.

## Technical Summary
This system uses two high-resolution RGB-D cameras rigidly mounted around the conveyor accessory. I developed a precise multi-camera calibration pipeline to align all depth and color data into the robot base frame for consistent, metric spatial reasoning.

On top of the fused scene geometry, I designed and implemented real-time perception logic to:
- Detect picking success and classify failure modes via point-cloud differencing and motion cues.
- Track box position and orientation on the conveyor.
- Continuously estimate clearance between the robot arm and surrounding objects to prevent collisions.
- Provide both high-level pick state and low-level spatial constraints to the robot motion controller.

The system operates at real-time rates and is fully integrated into Pixmo’s core perception-planning loop.

## Results
The system has been deployed to all active commercial customer sites and operates continuously in production:

- **Zero** robot-to-box collisions on the conveyor accessory system since deployment.
- **Increased unloading throughput** due to reduced motion conservatism.
- **Reliable autonomous failure detection**, reducing operator intervention and downtime.

This perception system is now a core safety and performance component of Pixmo’s commercial product.
