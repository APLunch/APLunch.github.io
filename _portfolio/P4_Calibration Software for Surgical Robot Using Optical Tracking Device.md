## Objective
Accurate and precise calibration is critical to surgical robots. The “Yomi” dental surgical robot uses a 7-joint un-actuated mechanical arm to track the patient’s posture. The existing calibration procedure is tiring and highly operator-dependent. The goal of this project is to utilize an optical tracking device and implement a novel calibration method that is faster and less operator-dependent, without losing accuracy or precision.

## Technical Summary
Designed and manufactured passive optical marker(s); developed the mathematical model for arm calibration; designed the calibration procedure; implemented the software that communicates with the camera and the robot; implemented the data-processing algorithm, rigid body registration algorithm, result validation algorithm, and the optimization algorithm for the kinematic parameters of the arm; composed utility tool that monitors joint-space coverage in real-time; 

## Results
The novel calibration method satisfies the precision and accuracy requirement and is significantly faster and less operator dependent than the existing method. RMS error ~0.2mm. The new method is being considered to replace the existing one.
