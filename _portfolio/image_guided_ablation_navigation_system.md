## Objective
This project focuses on creating demonstration software for a novel liver cancer ablation device, designed to optimize procedural workflow. The software features sophisticated visual representation of the patient's liver anatomy from CT scans, emphasizing the identification of cancerous lesions. A key component is the integration of a custom communication interface for the electromagnetic (EM) tracking system, which precisely tracks the medical tool in real-time, displaying its pose with six degrees of freedom (6DOF) for detailed movements and functionalities. The software aims to highlight the benefits of this innovative tool and approach, surpassing traditional liver cancer treatments, all through a visually compelling and intuitive interface.

## Technical Summary
Utilized 3D Slicer, external tracking devices, and Python with VTK, Qt, and IGTL libraries. Developed a bespoke communication interface for accurate, real-time tool tracking. Further details are confidential due to NDA constraints.

## Results
Successfully highlighted the new medical device's capabilities, offering precise anatomical visualization and real-time tool tracking, demonstrating its advantages over conventional methods in a user-friendly software platform.
