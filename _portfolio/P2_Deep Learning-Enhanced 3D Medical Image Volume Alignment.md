## Objective
The project aims to leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for developing a sophisticated descriptor capable of accurately aligning 3D ultrasound/CT volumes, enhancing the precision of medical imaging analysis.

## Technical Details
Utilizing a CNN architecture, we trained descriptors on a dataset of 3D ultrasound images, focusing on extracting rotationally invariant features for robust volume registration. 
The model underwent rigorous training, employing techniques like the triplet loss function for enhanced descriptor differentiation. 
This approach ensures precise matching and alignment of ultrasound volumes, crucial for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. 
Further development and optimization were conducted under strict confidentiality, with more details constrained by NDA.

## Results
The implementation demonstrated superior performance in aligning ultrasound volumes, outperforming traditional hand-crafted descriptors like 3D SIFT or 3D SURF. 
The trained CNN descriptors achieved significant improvements in registration accuracy and robustness with much less computation power required.
