History moves loudly, yet progress moves quietly.  
We imagine breakthroughs as explosions of discovery —  
but more often they are the result of thousands of small, patient steps.

Artificial intelligence did not arrive suddenly.  
It grew through silent errors, subtle improvements, and persistent curiosity.

So too in our own lives: growth is rarely dramatic.  
Yet every day we refine ourselves, just a bit.  
And that is enough.
