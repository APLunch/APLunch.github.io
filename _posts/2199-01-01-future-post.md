We talk about innovation as though it appears out of thin air — a spark, a genius moment, a sudden advancement.  
But every tool, circuit, and algorithm has a lineage.  
They are built on the labor of countless hands, many of which history never names.

Factories hum quietly. Assembly lines move like practiced choreography.  
Robots weld, stack, sort — yet each movement was once taught by someone who *worked*.

It is said that automation will reshape society. Perhaps it will.  
But if technology forgets the worker, it forgets its own origin.  
The value of a robot is not that it replaces the hand —  
but that it *remembers what the hand once did*, and carries it forward.

Progress is not just invention.  
Progress is honoring the invisible work that makes invention possible.

> "Nothing is created alone. Every step rests upon those who came before."

Let the future be built not only with efficiency,  
but with respect.
