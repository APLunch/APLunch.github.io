All systems have uncertainty — robots, humans, life itself.  
We try to calculate outcomes and reduce risk, but some unpredictability is unavoidable.

And that's okay.

> "To step into the unknown is to acknowledge that we are alive."

In robotics, uncertainty is handled through feedback loops —  
we observe, adjust, continue.

So too with living:
observe  
adjust  
continue.

A life without uncertainty would be a machine running a script.  
You are not meant to be a script.
