A tool is neither good nor evil. A hammer can build a home or shatter a window.  
A machine can stitch a wound or fire a weapon.  
The value emerges from the *intention* behind the hand that guides it.

The more advanced our tools become, the more important the guiding values must be.  
Robots, algorithms, and intelligent systems mirror our thinking patterns.  
If our patterns are unclear, the machine will magnify that confusion.

Technology is never merely practical. It is deeply moral.
