Automation is often seen as a way to make tasks easier — but this is only the surface.  
What we *really* seek is **more time**. More time for thought, for creativity, for being human.

A robot folding laundry is not exciting.  
A robot freeing a person to write music, love, or rest — *that* is meaningful.

In that sense, automation is not the removal of human effort —  
it is the redirection of human purpose.
